## Existing Functions

### Data replace

This function replaces the \*.db data files with new versions by
matching the deployment IDâ€™s and replacing the appropriate data files

``` r
SEB_data_replace("C:/Pathname.../new data","C:/Pathname.../Deployment directories")
```

### Data replace

This function concatenates the \*.db data files from multiple
deployments into a single frame table (which includes accessory data)
and a target table.

``` r
SEB_data_concatenate("C:/Pathname.../Deployment directories")
```
